   - How do you determine which type of tea to use?

2. **Kettle/Pot Temperature Control**
   - Does your kettle or pot have a temperature control feature? If so, how precise is it?
   - What methods do you use to ensure water reaches the desired temperature for different types of tea?

3. **Quantity of Tea Leaves**
   - How do you determine the amount of tea leaves per person (e.g., one teaspoon)?
   - Do you adjust the quantity based on personal preference or strength requirements?

4. **Availability of a Strainer**
   - What type of strainer do you use for removing tea leaves?

   - How do you ensure that this step maintains the desired serving temperature of the tea?

8. **Measuring Time for Steeping**
   - What tools or methods do you use to measure steeping time accurately?
   - How do you ensure consistency in steeping duration across different brewing sessions?

9. **Cleaning and Storing Tea Leaves/Bags**
   - What techniques do you use for cleaning and storing tea leaves or bags properly?
   - How do you prevent contamination during storage to preserve quality?

10. **Access to Fresh Cold Water**
