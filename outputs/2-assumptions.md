**Assumptions List for The Simplest Way to Make a Cup of Tea Workflow**

1. **Tea Variety Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Steeping time varies depending on tea variety.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): 2-5 minutes (average steeping time).
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 4.1 in **Steep and Infuse**.
	* Additional context or explanation: Different teas have unique steeping times, so it's essential to research or follow package instructions for specific tea.

2. **Water Quality Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Using fresh, cold water prevents off-flavors in tea.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 1.2 in **Gather Ingredients** and throughout the workflow.
	* Additional context or explanation: Fresh, cold water is crucial for optimal flavor and aroma.

3. **Equipment Maintenance Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Regular kettle cleaning and descaling ensure optimal performance.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Not explicitly mentioned in workflow but noted as a consideration.
	* Additional context or explanation: Regular maintenance is necessary to prevent scaling buildup, ensuring the kettle functions correctly.

4. **Tea Measurement Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Measuring tea leaves or bags accurately ensures proper flavor and strength.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): 1 teaspoon of loose-leaf tea or 1 tea bag per cup.
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 3.1 in **Prepare Tea**.
	* Additional context or explanation: Accurate measurement is crucial for achieving desired flavor and strength.

5. **Steeping Time Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Steeping time may vary depending on personal preference.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): 2-5 minutes (average steeping time).
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 4.1 in **Steep and Infuse**.
	* Additional context or explanation: Steeping time is subjective, and individuals may prefer longer or shorter steeping times.

6. **Strainer Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Using a strainer for loose-leaf tea prevents leaves from entering the cup.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 4.2 in **Steep and Infuse**.
	* Additional context or explanation: A strainer is recommended to prevent loose leaves from being consumed.

7. **Sweetener and Creamer Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Adding sweeteners and creamers according to taste may affect flavor balance.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substeps 5.1 and 5.2 in **Add Sweeteners and Creamers**.
	* Additional context or explanation: Personal preference plays a significant role in determining the amount of sweeteners and creamers added.

8. **Equipment Condition Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Using clean and well-maintained equipment ensures optimal performance.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Throughout the workflow.
	* Additional context or explanation: Clean and well-maintained equipment is crucial for preventing contamination and ensuring optimal flavor.

9. **Personal Preference Assumption**
	* Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Individual preferences may vary regarding tea strength, flavor, and sweetness levels.
	* Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
	* Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Throughout the workflow.
	* Additional context or explanation: Personal preference plays a significant role in determining the final product.

10. **Tea Package Instructions Assumption**
    * Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified: Following package instructions for specific tea varieties ensures optimal steeping times and flavor profiles.
    * Assumed value (if applicable): N/A
    * Related process step(s) where the assumption applies: Substep 4.1 in **Steep and Infuse**.
    * Additional context or explanation: Package instructions provide valuable information for achieving desired results.

This list addresses potential areas of uncertainty, ambiguity, or gaps in the described process, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the workflow.
