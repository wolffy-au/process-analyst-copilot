1. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The ideal water temperature for brewing different types of tea is not explicitly stated.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - 80-100Â°C/176-212Â°F for black tea and lower temperatures for green tea.
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Prepare the Tea
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - Understanding the ideal water temperature is crucial to extract the desired flavor from different types of tea. Incorrect temperatures may lead to under-extracted or over-extracted tea, affecting its taste and quality.

2. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The steeping time for herbal teas is not mentioned.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - Similar to green tea, with a steeping time of 1-3 minutes.
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Brew the Tea
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - Herbal teas may require different steeping times compared to black and green teas. Without guidance, users might adopt the same steeping times as for other tea types, potentially leading to under- or over-steeping.

3. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that users will have access to fresh water that has been purified or filtered.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Gather Ingredients
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - Not all users may have access to fresh, purified, or filtered water. This assumption could lead to confusion for those who rely on tap water or other sources that may not be as pure.

4. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that the user has a suitable strainer and teapot or cups with lids.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Strain and Serve
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - Not all users may have access to these items, which are necessary for removing tea leaves from the brewed tea. Without clarification, some users might not know how to strain their tea effectively.

5. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that users will adjust quantities and brewing times according to their personal liking.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Gather Ingredients and Brew the Tea
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - This assumption might not be clear to beginners who may need more guidance on how much tea leaves to use and how long to steep, depending on their taste preferences.

6. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that users will store brewed tea away from direct sunlight and heat after brewing.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Enjoy Your Tea
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - This instruction is important for maintaining the quality of the tea. However, it might not be clear to all users how long they should keep the brewed tea away from sunlight and heat.

7. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that users will clean their equipment with warm soapy water.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Clean Up
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - This instruction is important for maintaining hygiene and preventing mold growth. However, it might not be clear to all users that warm soapy water is the recommended cleaning method.

8. **Assumption:**
   - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified:
     - The document assumes that users will dry their equipment thoroughly before storing.
   - Assumed value (if applicable):
     - N/A
   - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies:
     - Clean Up and Store the tea
   - Additional context or explanation:
     - This instruction is important for preventing water spots and mold growth. However, it might not be clear to all users how thoroughly they should dry their equipment before storing it away.

By addressing these assumptions, we can provide clearer guidance for accurate process documentation and ensure that users have a better understanding of the tea-making process.
