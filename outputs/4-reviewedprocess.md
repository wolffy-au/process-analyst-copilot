     - Green tea: 80-85°C (175-185°F)
     - Herbal tea: 95-100°C (203-212°F)
   - **Assumption:** Kettle or pot can reach and maintain precise temperatures.

3. **Prepare the Teapot/Cup**
   - Pre-warm by rinsing with hot water.
   - Discard rinse water to ensure temperature retention during steeping.

4. **Add Tea Leaves/Bag**
   - Use one teaspoon of loose tea leaves per person, plus an extra "for the pot."
   - Alternatively, place a tea bag in each cup for individual servings.
   - **Assumption:** Standardized quantity of tea leaves ensures consistent strength and flavor.

5. **Pour Boiled Water**
   - Pour over tea leaves or bags, ensuring all are submerged for even steeping.

6. **Steep the Tea**
   - Steep according to type:
     - Black tea: 3-5 minutes
     - Green tea: 2-3 minutes
     - Herbal tea: 5-7 minutes
   - Adjust time based on desired strength.
   - **Assumption:** User can measure steeping time accurately.

7. **Remove Leaves/Bags**
   - Use a strainer to remove loose leaves from the teapot.
   - Discard or gently squeeze tea bags for additional flavor extraction, if preferred.
   - **Assumption:** Availability of a suitable strainer.

8. **Add Enhancements (Optional)**
   - Add milk, sugar, lemon, honey, or sweeteners according to taste preference.
   - Stir well to combine all ingredients.
   - **Assumption:** Optional enhancements are available and preferred by the user.

9. **Serve and Enjoy**
   - Pour tea into cups immediately while hot to maintain optimal temperature.

10. **Post-Preparation Cleanup**
    - Clean teapot, kettle, and utensils used.
    - Store leftover tea leaves or bags properly for future use.
    - **Assumption:** User knows proper cleaning and storage techniques.
