**1. Gather Ingredients**
   - Ensure that you have your preferred tea leaves or tea bags readily available.
   - Verify that the kettle is filled with fresh water and properly placed on the stovetop.
   - Check that sugar, milk (or preferred dairy/milk alternative), and any desired sweeteners are accessible.

   - **Assumption:** It is assumed that you are familiar with the types of tea and their preparation requirements.

**2. Heat Water**
   - Turn the stove to medium-high heat.
   - Wait for the water to reach a rolling boil.
   - Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer to maintain warmth.

   - **Assumption:** You understand that the boiling point of water may differ based on altitude and are aware of your brewing altitude.

**3. Prepare Tea**
   - Measure out one teaspoon of loose-leaf tea or use one tea bag per cup.
   - Place the measured tea into a teapot or directly into your cup if you're using a tea infuser.
   - Pour the heated water over the tea leaves or tea bag to initiate infusion.

   - **Assumption:** You consistently measure the amount of water and tea you use, having a standard method or tool for measurement.

**4. Steep and Infuse**
   - Allow the tea to steep for the recommended time (often 2-5 minutes, depending on your preference).
   - If using loose-leaf tea, consider straining over your cup to catch any leaves.

   - **Assumption:** It is presumed that you can adjust the steeping time based on taste preferences.

**5. Add Sweeteners and Creamers**
   - Add sugar, honey, or other sweeteners as per your taste.
   - Pour in milk (or preferred dairy/milk alternative) if desired.

   - **Assumption:** Users are familiar with how to adjust flavorings and additives according to personal preferences.

**6. Serve and Enjoy**
   - Transfer the tea to your cup via a teapot or directly from the infuser.
   - Stir thoroughly to ensure proper mixing of all ingredients.
   - Serve immediately and enjoy the tea.

   - **Assumption:** You understand the cooling time needed before consumption to reach a comfortable drinking temperature.

**Final Considerations**
- Regularly clean and descale your kettle to ensure optimal performance.
- Be aware that variations in kettle type may affect boiling efficiency, and adjust your methods accordingly.

By following these structured and detailed steps, you can create a precise and enjoyable tea-making process that minimizes ambiguity while incorporating all necessary assumptions.
