To make a good cup of tea, follow these steps:

1. **Gather Ingredients**:
   - Select high-quality tea leaves or bags based on your preference.
   - Use fresh water that has been purified or filtered.

2. **Prepare the Tea**:
   - Boil the water in a kettle until it reaches the desired temperature (usually around 80-100°C/176-212°F for black tea, and lower temperatures for green tea).
   - While the water is heating, place the tea leaves or bags into a teapot or individual cups.

3. **Brew the Tea**:
   - Pour the hot water over the tea leaves or bags.
   - Steep the tea for 3-5 minutes for black tea and 1-3 minutes for green tea. Adjust steeping time based on personal preference and tea type.

4. **Strain and Serve**:
   - Once steeped, remove the tea leaves or bags from the water.
   - Pour the tea into cups or a teapot with a strainer to keep the leaves out of the final brew.

5. **Add Optional Ingredients (if desired)**:
   - Stir in sugar, honey, milk, creamer, or lemon according to taste.
   - Add sweeteners and dairy products gradually to taste.

6. **Serve Immediately**:
   - Serve the tea hot, along with any accompaniments such as biscuits or pastries.

7. **Enjoy Your Tea**:
   - Sip your tea slowly and savor its flavor.
   - Keep the tea away from direct sunlight and heat after brewing to maintain its quality.

8. **Clean Up**:
   - Wash the cups, teapot, strainer, and any other equipment used with warm soapy water.
   - Dry them thoroughly before storing to prevent water spots or mold growth.

By following these steps, you can create a good cup of tea that suits your taste preferences. Adjust quantities and brewing times according to the type of tea and your personal liking for an optimal experience.
