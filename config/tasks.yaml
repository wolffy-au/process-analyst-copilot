draft_process:
  description: >
    Develop a detailed workflow outlining the necessary actions to accomplish the task specified in:
    `{input_ask}`
    Break the task into clear, logical, and sequential steps, ensuring the process is well-structured, actionable, and 
    accounts for any dependencies, decision points, or notable considerations.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive, well-organized list of process steps. Each step should be concise, easy to 
    follow, and include additional context or substeps as needed to avoid ambiguity. Use numbered lists or nested 
    bullet points to represent hierarchical workflows where applicable.

capture_assumptions:
  description: >
    Review the detailed process document `{draft_file}` to identify areas with uncertainties, ambiguities, or gaps in the described process. 
    Clearly articulate these areas of uncertainty and develop a well-structured list of assumptions that require clarification.
    Document these assumptions in detail along with their assumed values, if applicable, to provide context for future reference.
    The goal is to ensure all uncertainties are highlighted and refined for accurate process documentation.
  expected_output: >
    Provide a thorough, structured, comprehensive list of well-articulated assumptions addressing identified ambiguities or gaps in the draft process.
    Ensure no critical detail or ambiguity overlooked, laying the groundwork for accurate and complete documentation.
    Each assumption should include the following details:
      - Specific assumption, gap or uncertainty identified
      - Assumed value (if applicable)
      - Related process step(s) where the assumption applies
      - Additional context or explanation for a thorough understanding of the importance and impact on the process
    The list should be detailed and complete, leaving no critical detail or ambiguity unaddressed, providing a strong foundation for accurate and refined process documentation.

clarify_details:
  description: >
    Develop a comprehensive set of targeted, specific questions to gather essential information from the user. This
    aims to identify and address potential ambiguities or missing details within the assumptions listed in
    `{assumptions_file}`. The goal is to minimize assumptions and ensure that all critical information is clarified
    with as few uncertainties remaining unaddressed.
    These questions should focus on refining the process for accuracy and completeness, similar to asking "What type
    of tea should be used?" or "What is the desired serving temperature?" when making tea.
  expected_output: >
    Provide a well-organized list of questions addressing the assumptions identified during analysis.

reviewed_process:
  description: >
    Review the documents `{draft_file}`, `{assumptions_file}`, and `{questions_file}` to revisit, refine, and optimize
    the original process outlined in `{draft_file}`. This review should integrate clarified details from user
    responses while reducing reliance on assumptions. The objective is to create a precise and actionable process.

  expected_output: >
    Present an enhanced version of the process steps that incorporate clarified information, ensuring logical
    structure and actionability. Remove unnecessary ambiguities and minimize dependency on assumptions. Include
    references to any remaining assumptions used within the process for transparency.
