I want to create unit tests for the above agent and tasks. Can you suggest a good way to test these in python, either using pytest unit testing or behave gherkin testing methods?



To effectively test your AI agent and tasks in Python, you can utilize either pytest for unit testing or behave
(Gherkin) for behavior-driven development (BDD). Here's how each approach might be applied:

**Using Pytest:**
Pytest is a robust framework for writing simple and scalable tests. It supports various testing frameworks such as
unittest and allows you to write concise test functions.

1. Define your agent methods or task processing logic in Python classes or modules.
2. Write pytest functions (tests) that verify the correctness of your agent's responses, given specific input
conditions.

```python
# Example using pytest

import pytest

def test_agent_response():
    # Given some input data
    input_data = ...

    # When calling your agent's method or task processing logic
    result = your_agent_method(input_data)

    # Then assert that the result meets your expected output
    assert result == expected_output
```

**Using Behave (Gherkin):**
Behave is a BDD tool that helps write test cases in plain language, making it easier for stakeholders to
understand. It uses Gherkin, which allows you to define the behavior of the system using simple English.

1. Define the feature and steps in your Gherkin file(s) (`.feature` files).
2. Write Python step implementations that correspond to each step definition.

```gherkin
# Example using Behave (Gherkin)

Feature: Testing Agent's Functionality

Scenario: Successful Response from AI Agent
  Given I have input data
  When I process the data with the AI agent
  Then the response should be as expected
```

In your Python code:

```python
# Example using Behave (Gherkin)

from behave import given, when, then

@given('I have input data')
def step_given_data(context):
    context.input_data = ...  # Set up your input data

@when('I process the data with the AI agent')
def step_process_data(context):
    context.result = your_agent_method(context.input_data)

@then('the response should be as expected')
def step_check_result(context):
    assert context.result == expected_output
```

These are just starting points, and you can expand upon them based on your specific requirements and the
complexity of your agent's tasks. Both pytest and behave are powerful tools with extensive documentation to help
you create comprehensive tests for your AI agent.

1. Unit Testing with Pytest
With pytest, you can write unit tests that focus on individual functions or methods within your agent's tasks. You'll test each task's behavior, ensuring that the expected inputs produce the correct outputs.

Steps for Unit Testing:

Set Up the Test Environment:
Youâ€™ll need to create mock inputs, and outputs, and set up fixtures as necessary to isolate the tasks.

Test Task Descriptions and Expected Outputs:
Write tests to check that the tasks' outputs match expectations when given certain inputs.

Mocking Dependencies:
For tasks that involve external files or user input, you can use mock objects or fixtures to simulate these dependencies.

Example of Unit Tests Using Pytest:
Assuming you have the following functions for tasks:

draft_process()
capture_assumptions()
clarify_details()
You can write unit tests for each:

python
Copy code
import pytest
from agent import draft_process, capture_assumptions, clarify_details

# Example test case for `draft_process`
def test_draft_process():
    input_ask = "Make a cup of tea"
    expected_output = [
        "Step 1: Boil water",
        "Step 2: Add tea leaves or tea bag to cup",
        "Step 3: Pour hot water into the cup",
        "Step 4: Steep for desired time",
        "Step 5: Remove tea bag or leaves",
        "Step 6: Serve"
    ]
    
    result = draft_process(input_ask)
    assert result == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {result}"

# Example test case for `capture_assumptions`
def test_capture_assumptions():
    assumptions_file = "assumptions.md"
    draft_file = "draft_process.md"
    
    expected_output = [
        "What type of tea should be used?",
        "What is the desired steeping time?",
        "What is the preferred serving temperature?"
    ]
    
    result = capture_assumptions(assumptions_file, draft_file)
    assert result == expected_output, f"Expected {expected_output}, but got {result}"

# Example test case for `clarify_details`
def test_clarify_details():
    assumptions_file = "assumptions.md"
    draft_file = "draft_process.md"
    assumptions = {
        "tea_type": "black tea",
        "steeping_time": "5 minutes"
    }
    clarified_output = [
        "Assumption: Tea type is black tea.",
        "Assumption: Steeping time is 5 minutes.",
        "Updated Step 1: Boil water.",
        "Updated Step 2: Add black tea leaves to cup.",
        "Updated Step 3: Pour hot water into the cup."
    ]
    
    result = clarify_details(assumptions, draft_file)
    assert result == clarified_output, f"Expected {clarified_output}, but got {result}"
Run Tests:
To run your tests with pytest, you would run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
pytest test_agent.py
This will execute the tests and show you whether they pass or fail.

2. Behavior-Driven Testing with Behave
For behavior-driven testing, you can use Behave with Gherkin syntax. This allows you to describe your agent's behavior in natural language, then implement Python code that matches those behaviors.

Steps for Behavior-Driven Development:

Write Feature Files:
Create .feature files using Gherkin syntax that describe the expected behavior of the agentâ€™s tasks.

Implement Step Definitions:
Implement Python functions that link the Gherkin steps to your agent's logic.

Example of Behave Test Using Gherkin:
Create a Feature File (draft_process.feature):
gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Draft process creation

  Scenario: Create a process for making a cup of tea
    Given I have a request to "Make a cup of tea"
    When I document the process steps
    Then I should get the following steps:
      | Step  | Description              |
      | Step 1| Boil water               |
      | Step 2| Add tea leaves to cup    |
      | Step 3| Pour hot water into cup  |
      | Step 4| Steep tea for desired time |
      | Step 5| Remove tea bag or leaves |
      | Step 6| Serve tea                |
Create Step Definitions (steps.py):
python
Copy code
from behave import given, when, then
from agent import draft_process

@given('I have a request to "{input_ask}"')
def step_impl_given_request(context, input_ask):
    context.input_ask = input_ask

@when('I document the process steps')
def step_impl_when_document_process(context):
    context.result = draft_process(context.input_ask)

@then('I should get the following steps:')
def step_impl_then_verify_steps(context):
    expected_steps = [
        "Step 1: Boil water",
        "Step 2: Add tea leaves to cup",
        "Step 3: Pour hot water into cup",
        "Step 4: Steep tea for desired time",
        "Step 5: Remove tea bag or leaves",
        "Step 6: Serve tea"
    ]
    assert context.result == expected_steps, f"Expected {expected_steps}, but got {context.result}"
Run Behave Tests:
To run your tests with Behave, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
behave
This will execute the behavior-driven tests, ensuring that the agent performs as expected when given different inputs.

Summary:
Pytest is great for unit testing, allowing you to focus on testing specific functions or methods in isolation. You would create mock inputs and verify that each task is performing correctly.
Behave with Gherkin is suitable for testing the agentâ€™s behavior in a more user-centric and business-friendly way. It allows you to write natural language scenarios that describe the expected behavior of your tasks, making it easier to communicate the testing process to non-technical stakeholders.
By using both approaches, you can ensure that your agent behaves correctly both at the unit level and in terms of overall user experience.






You said:
Rather than using assert, am I able to check if the reponses are semantically the same using generative AI LLM calls?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use Generative AI LLM (Large Language Model) calls to check if the responses are semantically the same, rather than relying solely on traditional methods like assertions. To achieve this, you would use an embedding-based similarity comparison to evaluate the semantic similarity between expected and actual outputs. Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture its meaning, which can then be compared to measure how semantically similar two pieces of text are.

Steps to Use Generative AI for Semantic Similarity:
Generate Embeddings for Expected and Actual Outputs: You can use a pre-trained language model (like GPT, BERT, or OpenAIâ€™s embeddings models) to generate embeddings for both the expected output (your predefined list of steps) and the actual output (the response from your agent).

Compute Cosine Similarity: Once you have the embeddings, you can compute the cosine similarity between them. A high similarity score (close to 1) indicates that the two pieces of text are semantically similar, while a lower score suggests differences in meaning.

Threshold for Semantic Match: You can define a threshold for what is considered a "match." For example, if the cosine similarity is above 0.9, you might consider the outputs semantically the same.

Example Approach in Python with OpenAI API (or any embedding model):
Prerequisites:
Install openai or transformers (depending on the model you're using) for embeddings.
bash
Copy code
pip install openai numpy
Code Example Using OpenAI API:
python
Copy code
import openai
import numpy as np

# Set up your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# Function to get embeddings from OpenAI's API
def get_embeddings(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=text,
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"  # Use OpenAI's embedding model
    )
    return np.array(response['data'][0]['embedding'])

# Function to compute cosine similarity
def cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2):
    return np.dot(embedding1, embedding2) / (np.linalg.norm(embedding1) * np.linalg.norm(embedding2))

# Example test case for semantic similarity check
def test_semantic_similarity(expected_output, actual_output):
    # Get embeddings for both expected and actual outputs
    expected_embedding = get_embeddings(expected_output)
    actual_embedding = get_embeddings(actual_output)
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity
    similarity_score = cosine_similarity(expected_embedding, actual_embedding)
    
    # Define a threshold for "semantic equivalence"
    threshold = 0.9
    
    print(f"Similarity score: {similarity_score}")
    if similarity_score >= threshold:
        print("The responses are semantically the same!")
    else:
        print("The responses are different.")

# Example usage:
expected = "Step 1: Boil water. Step 2: Add tea leaves. Step 3: Pour water into cup."
actual = "Step 1: Heat the water. Step 2: Put tea leaves into the cup. Step 3: Pour the hot water."

test_semantic_similarity(expected, actual)
Explanation:
get_embeddings: This function uses the OpenAI API to generate text embeddings for a given string. These embeddings are high-dimensional vectors that represent the semantic content of the text.
cosine_similarity: The cosine similarity formula measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. A value close to 1 indicates that the vectors are similar in meaning.
test_semantic_similarity: This function computes the similarity between the expected and actual output based on their embeddings and compares it against a threshold.
Expected Output:
If the similarity score is above 0.9 (adjustable threshold), it will indicate that the two responses are semantically the same. You can change the threshold depending on how strict you want to be about semantic equivalence.

Considerations:
Handling Variations: This approach works well when the wording differs but the meaning is the same. For example, "Add tea leaves" and "Put tea leaves into the cup" would likely have a high similarity score.
Performance: Embedding models like OpenAIâ€™s may require some API calls, which could be slower and cost more compared to simpler traditional methods. However, for complex, nuanced comparisons, this is an effective solution.
Granularity: You could also compare sentence-by-sentence or process step-by-process step for more fine-grained checks.
